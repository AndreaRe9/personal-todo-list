## What's behind this project?

One day I needed a place to write my tasks in a way that I could always look at them in my computer. Surfing the internet, I found different solutions, all of them rich of beautiful features that I didn't need. So, I started to think that I could do something on my own.

## Why I love it

There are a couple reasons why I love this project:
* It's **scalable**, with the possibility to implement a lot of functionalities
* It's **didactic**, because I learned new things about Vanilla Javascript, SQLite and Web development
* It's **useful**, at least to me :)

## Build with
* Node.js 12.18
* Electron 9.1.0
